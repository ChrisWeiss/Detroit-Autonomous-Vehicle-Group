# Wireless Donkey Car

Instructions for how to setup RPi 3B for DonkeyCar as own hotspot -- The motivation for this change to the
[Donkey Car](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar/) project is to use the Raspberry Pi 3's built-in Wi-Fi
to connect to the car to control it.

## A Donkey 2.5.8 Based Image

A [Donkey release 2.5.8](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar/releases) based
[image](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PilLO1pO8E0svKNTesbsRzfwsOkGkmfx) (‚áê Click to download from Google Drive)
is created to accelerate deployment.

The image is downloaded as a 1.3GB .zip compressed file. It unzips into a 3GB .img file, with a file name that says 2.5.0
-- Ignore that discrepency for now, it will be fixed later. The .img file may be used to burn a 32GB SD card using any
SD writing tool, such as [etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

### Expanding the root partition

Install the SD card on the Raspberry Pi 3, run ```sudo raspi-config``` to expand the root file system partition to use
the entire card.

Find [more details here](http://cagewebdev.com/raspberry-pi-expanding-the-root-partition-of-the-sd-card/).

## Connecting to the Car with Wi-Fi

Once the RPi3 on the car is started, a new Wi-Fi access point should show up on any 802.11b/g/n device,
with the SSID ```LXLCar```. (If you don't see that, the RPi3's ethernet port may be used for troubleshooting.)

The Wi-Fi key is ```A2AutonomousVehicle```. After connecting on that Wi-Fi connection, say with a laptop,
the laptop should get an IP address in the range of ```192.168.89.xxx```. The car's IP address is ```192.168.89.1```.

## SSH into the Car

I used openssh, and here is my configuration for connecting to the car in ```~/.ssh/config```:
```
Host  mycar
      Hostname 192.168.89.1
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_mycar
      User pi
```
The user ```pi```'s password is ```RaspberryPi```.

Here is the private key (This private SSH key is not encrypted. So DO NOT use it for
anything else but the donkey car.) to be stored in ```~/.ssh/id_mycar```:
```

### Using tmux

Most of the work described in this document are done in the Linux terminal. Most of the programs
run this way would stop running if the terminal session is ended. To keep a program running, even
in the case of an accidental drop of SSH connection, for example, programs such as ```screen```
and ```tmux``` can help.

To use ```tmux```, simply enter the command before any other command.

To check for previous ```tmux``` session:
```
$ tmux list-sessions
0: 5 windows (created Sun Mar  3 22:40:14 2019) [189x64] (attached)
```

To attach to a session:
```
$ tmux attach-session
```

When inside ```tmux```, use the key combination ```ctrl-B d``` to detach from the session.

## Changing the Name of the Car

Once SSH'ed into the car, edit the ```/etc/hostap/hostap.conf``` file by finding the
two lines and change the values to what you like:
```
ssid=LXLCar
wpa_passphrase=A2AutonomousVehicle
```
The ```channel=1``` may be changed to select a different channel for the Wi-Fi radio.
Only set it to 1, 6 or 11. A value of 0 (zero) or ```acs_survey``` for automatic
channel selection, but that is not tested.

The ```/etc/hostname``` file may also be changed to set the hostname in Linux.

## Calibration

Three things need to be done to calibrate the car.

First, find out how the car is wired. two channels are defined in the ```mycar/config.py``` file:

```
STEERING_CHANNEL = 1
THROTTLE_CHANNEL = 0
```

That may or may not match the wiring of your car's servo and motor control.

To find out which channel controls steering, for example, calibrate it by:
```
$ donkey calibrate --channel 1
```

If it turns our that channel 1 in fact does not control steering, it may be fixed either by
switching the wire connections on the PWM module, or by editing the configuration file.

## Driving

To start driving, run:
```shell
$ cd ~/mycar
$ ./manage.py drive
```

After that, go to http://192.168.89.1:8887 to access the donkey car control.
